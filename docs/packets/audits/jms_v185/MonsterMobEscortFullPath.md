# MonsterMobEscortFullPath (← `CMob::OnEscortFullPath`)

- **IDA:** 0x6efa01
- **Atlas file:** `libs/atlas-packet/monster/clientbound/mob_escort_full_path.go`
- **Variant:** JMS/v185
- **Branch depth:** 1
- **Verdict:** 🔍
- **Flat-diff-invalid:** the wire shape depends on a runtime discriminator a flat positional diff cannot model — the Atlas writer branches on a non-version condition (a data-dependent field or an untraced version-derived local), and/or the client reads fields conditionally (e.g. `mode <= 1`). The verdict is capped to 🔍; the row-level mismatches below are a modeling limitation, not a verified wire bug — confirm per-branch via byte-level tests.
