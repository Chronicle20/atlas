# task-086 Mount System — Deployment Notes

Operational steps required to roll out the mount feature. Read alongside `plan.md` and `context.md`.

## 1. New service: atlas-mounts

- New Go service `services/atlas-mounts` (REST + Kafka only; **no LB socket ports**). Registered in
  `.github/config/services.json`, `docker-bake.hcl` (`go_services`), `go.work`, and
  `deploy/k8s/base/atlas-mounts.yaml` (+ `kustomization.yaml`).
- **Database:** `DB_NAME: atlas-mounts` (own Postgres DB; GORM auto-migrates `character_mounts`).
- Consumes: `EVENT_TOPIC_CHARACTER_BUFF_STATUS` (registry + SET), `EVENT_TOPIC_CHARACTER_STATUS`
  (logout cleanup + job-change is handled via the cancel-all path, see §4), `EVENT_TOPIC_TAMING_MOB_FOOD` (feed).
- Produces: `EVENT_TOPIC_MOUNT_STATUS`.

## 2. Live tenant config patch (KNOWN PITFALL — applies to EXISTING tenants)

Seed templates apply only at tenant **creation**. Existing tenants will NOT get the new opcodes
automatically (ref memory `bug_new_opcodes_not_in_live_tenant_config`). Per channel, patch live config:

- **Inbound handler:** bind opcode **`0x4D`** → handle `MountFoodHandle` in the live `Socket.Handlers`.
- **Outbound writer:** bind the per-version opcode for writer name `SetTamingMobInfo` in the live `Socket.Writers`.
- **Then restart the channel** — the projection does NOT hot-reload handlers/writers.

Symptom if skipped: feeding the mount no-ops (client → "unhandled message op 0x4D" at info), and the
SET_TAMING_MOB_INFO broadcast silently drops (no level/exp/tiredness UI).

> The `0x4D` inbound opcode and the `SetTamingMobInfo` outbound opcode are the v83 baseline. Confirm
> the per-version opcode values for v87/v92/v95/JMS when patching those tenants (see §5).

## 3. New Kafka topics (env vars)

| Topic | Producer | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `COMMAND_TOPIC_TAMING_MOB_FOOD` | atlas-channel | atlas-consumables |
| `EVENT_TOPIC_TAMING_MOB_FOOD` | atlas-consumables | atlas-mounts |
| `EVENT_TOPIC_MOUNT_STATUS` | atlas-mounts | atlas-channel |

Ensure these topics exist / are auto-created per the cluster's Kafka topic policy.

## 4. Behavior change — job change now cancels ALL buffs (FR-4.2, user-approved)

The job-change saga (NPC `change_job` op in atlas-npc-conversations + the GM `@change … job` command in
atlas-messages) now appends a `cancel_all_buffs` step. **Every job change clears all active buffs**
server-wide (matches MapleStory job-advancement behavior). This is the mechanism that dismounts the
MaxInt32-duration mount buff on job change. Operators should be aware this affects all buffs, not just mounts.

## 5. Multi-version (PRE-DEPLOY GATE — Task 41b)

The mount packet **body layouts** are IDA-confirmed for **v83 only**. Before enabling the feature on any
non-v83 tenant (GMS 12/87/92/95, JMS 185), run the cross-version IDA verification (plan Task 41b) on the
v87/v95/JMS IDBs and add version branches where they differ:
1. Monster Riding two-state CTS stat encoding (`character_temporary_stat.go getBaseTemporaryStats`).
2. `SET_TAMING_MOB_INFO` body (`characterId,level,exp,tiredness,levelUp`).
3. Food request `0x4D` body (`ts,slot,itemId`).
Also re-confirm the mount skill ids (1004/1013/1017/1018/1019/1031 + Noblesse/Legend) in JMS skill data.

The architecture is otherwise version-agnostic (opcodes per-tenant config; CTS encoder already version-branched;
skill/item/quest data read per-tenant from each version's WZ).

## 6. FR-9 questline (Riding Mimiana)

- Quest **20523** already exists in WZ (GMS v83) and its `endActions` auto-award saddle **1912005**
  (class 191), taming-mob **1902005** (class 190), and skill **10001004** (MonsterRider), consuming
  quest item **4032117**, on NPC **1102002** (prereq quest **20522**).
- The new NPC conversation `deploy/seed/gms/83_1/npc-conversations/quests/quest-20523.json` starts/completes
  the quest; rewards flow from the WZ `EndActions` via atlas-quest `processEndActions` (no manual award —
  the `suppressAwardAssetByCompleteQuest` dedup would otherwise double-grant).
- **Per-version:** quest-20523 conversation is authored for v83 only. Other tenants that carry quest 20523
  in their WZ need their own per-version conversation seed (deferred to the multi-version pre-deploy pass).
- The mount **engine** works independently of the questline for any character with the (innate) MonsterRider
  skill + an equipped saddle (slot -19) + taming-mob (slot -18).

## 7. Caches / data redeploy

- atlas-data was changed (skill reader emits vehicle ids for skill-only mounts). If atlas-data is
  redeployed, no mount-specific cache clear is required (skill effects are not spawn-cached), but follow the
  standard atlas-data redeploy procedure.

## 8. Verification performed (this branch)

- `go build` / `go vet` / `go test -race` clean across all 8 changed modules (atlas-constants, atlas-packet,
  atlas-channel, atlas-consumables, atlas-data, atlas-messages, atlas-mounts, atlas-npc-conversations).
- `tools/redis-key-guard.sh` (workspace mode) clean (exit 0). Note: `GOWORK=off` variant fails on ~53
  modules with "matched no packages" — a **pre-existing** environmental go.mod-staleness issue present on
  `main`, NOT introduced by this branch; atlas-mounts passes the guard under both the direct analyzer and
  workspace mode.
- `docker buildx bake` clean for all 6 affected services: atlas-mounts, atlas-channel, atlas-data,
  atlas-consumables, atlas-npc-conversations, atlas-messages.

## 9. New-service PR-env onboarding (gaps hit during the PR #743 ephemeral deploy)

Adding the new `atlas-mounts` service required several PR-overlay / CI files beyond the base manifest +
services.json. These were NOT obvious from the plan and caused two deploy failures; the authoritative
checklist is `deploy/k8s/README.md` "Adding a new service". For atlas-mounts specifically:

1. **`.github/config/services.json`** — service entry (done in Task 39). Drives the CI build matrix AND
   the `ATLAS_SERVICES` cleanup list. After editing, **regenerate the cleanup artifact**:
   `deploy/k8s/overlays/pr/scripts/gen-cleanup-env.sh` → commit
   `dev/cluster-infra-coordination/atlas-pr-cleanup-env.example.yaml`. *(Missing this failed the
   "Resolve PR overlay" CI step → the `bot/pr-<N>-resolved` branch was never created → Argo
   `ComparisonError`, no namespace.)*
2. **`deploy/k8s/overlays/pr/kustomization.yaml` `images:` block** — add
   `ghcr.io/chronicle20/atlas-mounts/atlas-mounts` with `newTag: latest`. The "Resolve PR overlay" step
   bumps entries here to `pr-<N>-<sha>`; a service NOT in this list stays on `:latest`, which is never
   pushed → **ImagePullBackOff** (Argo Degraded).
3. **`ATLAS_DB_NAMES` literal** in the same kustomization.yaml `configMapGenerator` — add `atlas-mounts`.
   The `wave0-create-dbs` presync hook loops this list to `CREATE DATABASE` per PR env; a missing entry
   means the per-PR database is never created.
4. **`deploy/k8s/overlays/pr/scripts/gen-db-name-suffix.sh`** → regenerate `patches/db-name-suffix.yaml`
   (suffixes `DB_NAME` to `atlas-mounts-<env>` for per-PR DB isolation).
5. **`deploy/k8s/overlays/pr/scripts/gen-consumer-group-patch.sh`** → regenerate
   `patches/consumer-group-env.yaml` (per-PR Kafka consumer-group suffix; reads the `consumerGroupId`
   literal from the service `main.go`).
6. **New Kafka topics** → `deploy/k8s/base/env-configmap.yaml` + `deploy/compose/.env.example` +
   the topic literals in the PR overlay `configMapGenerator` (gen-topic-config.sh). Done in the DOM-23 fix.

Verification that the env came up: `atlas-mounts` pod Running/Ready on `...:pr-<N>-<sha>`, logs show
Redis connect + the three `*_TOPIC_*-<env>` consumers + the 60s tiredness task + HTTP :8080, and Argo
app health `Healthy`.

## Task 41b findings — food 0x4D + SET_TAMING_MOB_INFO (v83, IDA-verified 2026-06-13)

Verified against the v83 client (`MapleStory_dump.exe`, IDA port 13337):

### Food request (inbound, 0x4D) — CONFIRMED, now wired
`CWvsContext::SendTamingMobFoodItemUseRequest(short slot, int itemId)` builds
`COutPacket(0x4D); Encode4(get_update_time()); Encode2(slot); Encode4(itemId)`, gated to
equipped tamed-mob (`/10000==190`) + class-226 food (`itemId/10000==226`). Body =
`int32 ts, int16 slot, int32 itemId` — **exactly** atlas `mount/serverbound.Food`. The handler
was registered in the channel binary (`main.go`) but the opcode→handler mapping was **missing from
every tenant config** (seed templates + live tenants), so the keypress no-op'd ("unhandled op").
Fixes:
- Seed: added `{opCode:"0x4D", validator:"LoggedInValidator", handler:"MountFoodHandle"}` to
  `template_gms_83_1.json` `socket.handlers` (after `0x4C` PetFoodHandle; `0x4D` was free inbound).
- Live PR tenant `caceb952-…` (GMS 83.1): PATCHed the same entry into
  `/configurations/tenants/{id}` and restarted atlas-channel (handlers don't hot-reload).
- **Other versions (v87/v95/JMS/12/92): opcode NOT yet verified** — the serverbound table shifts
  across versions; do not copy 0x4D blindly. Verify per client before adding to those templates.

### SET_TAMING_MOB_INFO (outbound writer) — NO standalone opcode on v83
The mount level/exp/tiredness is **not** broadcast as its own packet on v83. It is delivered
**inside `LP_CharacterInfo`** (`CWvsContext::OnCharacterInfo`): after the avatar/pet block,
`Decode1(hasTamingMob)`, then `Decode4(level), Decode4(exp), Decode4(tiredness)` →
`CUIUserInfo::SetTamingMobInfo(level, exp, tiredness)` (3 ints, **no characterId, no levelUp**).
The atlas `SetTamingMobInfo` writer (`characterId,level,exp,tiredness,levelUp`) is a *later-version*
`LP_SetTamingMobInfo` shape and has **no v83 opcode to map to** — the SET/TICK/FEED broadcast from
the mount-status consumer is a dead no-op on v83 (writer name resolves to no opcode).
Implication / open work:
- To surface mount stats on v83, atlas must inject the `hasTamingMob + level/exp/tiredness` block
  into its **character-info response** (query atlas-mounts for the active mount), not broadcast a
  standalone packet. This is a char-info-integration feature, not an opcode registration.
- The standalone writer (Task 5/26/27) should be guarded/disabled for GMS<87 (and verified to be a
  real opcode on v87/v95/JMS before enabling there).

## Multi-version mount food opcodes + char-info injection (2026-06-13)

### Food (SendTamingMobFoodItemUseRequest) — inbound opcode per version (IDA-verified)
`COutPacket(opcode); Encode4(ts); Encode2(slot); Encode4(itemId)` — body identical
across versions; only the opcode differs.

| Version | opcode | source | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GMS v83 | 0x4D | v83 IDB | template + live PR tenant patched |
| GMS v87 | 0x50 | v87 IDB | template (`MountFoodHandle`) |
| GMS v95 | 0x53 | v95 IDB | template |
| JMS v185 | 0x45 | jms IDB | template |
| GMS v84 | ? | IDB unresponsive | **NOT added — verify before enabling** |
| GMS v12 / v92 | ? | no IDB loaded | **NOT added — load IDB + verify** |

Existing non-v83 tenants need the same live PATCH the v83 tenant got (seed templates
only apply at tenant creation). The PR env has only the v83 tenant, so no extra live
patch was needed here.

### Char-info mount block — injected (no standalone opcode this era)
v83/v87/v95 all read the tamed-mob stats inside `LP_CharacterInfo`, right after the pet
block: `Decode1(present)` then `level, exp, tiredness` (3×int32), uniform layout. The
`SET_TAMING_MOB_INFO` standalone broadcast does not exist pre-v8x-late; the writer's old
`WriteByte(0)` always said "no mount". Now `libs/atlas-packet` CharacterInfo carries a
`MountInfo` block; the channel char-info handler fetches the mount from atlas-mounts (new
`atlas-channel/mount` REST client) and emits it. nginx route added:
`/api/characters/{id}/mount -> atlas-mounts`. The standalone SET/TICK/FEED broadcast writer
(Task 5/26/27) remains a no-op on these versions and should be guarded off for GMS<87 (or
verified to be a real opcode on the version it targets).
