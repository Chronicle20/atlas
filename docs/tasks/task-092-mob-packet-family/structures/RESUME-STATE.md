# task-092 — Resume state (after Stage 0 / 0.5 / 1 / 1.5)

Last updated 2026-06-13. Foundation is built and committed; **Stage 2 (codecs) not started.**

## Done & committed (on `task-092-mob-packet-family`)
- **Stage 0** recon: baseline matrix clean; export-gap + registry-gap audits.
- **Stage 0.5 tooling** (`ca54ef850`): `packet-audit export` gained `--prior-export`/`--pending` (targeted harvest); `idasrc.GetFunctionByName` now bridges demangled→mangled via `func_query` fallback. Tested + live-verified.
- **Stage 1** (`551b00199`→`69b66a35c`): harvested byte layouts into `structures/<vk>.md`, refreshed all 5 IDA exports (absent-keys-only merge, no drift), fixed registry fnames.
- **Stage 1.5** IDB naming (`f7a2b4a8d`,`a2fe44636`,`7b8d7f0fe`,`e8def21fe`,`205f6974c`,`842103bff`): named ~24 unnamed mob functions (v84 22 + v83/jms TryDoingBodyAttack) by layout-match to v83 twins; re-harvested.
- `matrix --check` exit 0 throughout. The IDBs themselves were modified (renames persist in the user's .i64 files).

## Coverage now
- **v95**: full. **v87/v83/jms**: most ops pinnable. **v84**: 22 handlers named + pinnable.

## Residual blockers (small set — serverbound senders, inlined or undecompilable)
Decide per cell at Stage 2 (codec+test+route still land; only the evidence pin is affected):
- **MOB_BANISH_PLAYER** (`CUserLocal::SendBanMapByMobRequest`) — INLINED into `CUserLocal::Update`; no standalone function to pin (v83; check other versions).
- **MOB_TIME_BOMB_END** (`CMob::UpdateTimeBomb`) — INLINED into `CMob::Update` (v83, v87, v84).
- **v84 unnamed sender cluster**: MONSTER_BOMB (`TryFirstSelfDestruction`), MOB_DROP_PICKUP_REQUEST (`SendDropPickUpRequest`), TOUCH_MONSTER_ATTACK (`TryDoingBodyAttack`), MONSTER_BOOK_COVER (`SetMonsterBookCover`) — unnamed, no anchor symbols; not layout-matchable without building the namespace.
- **jms TOUCH_MONSTER_ATTACK** — symbol named at `0xA2AB71` but jms Hex-Rays FAILS to decompile it; resolves by address for manual evidence; layout inherits v83/v95.
- Options for these: (a) pin the parent `Update` function for inlined sends with a call-site note; (b) hand-author the byte-test from the sibling layout + a VERSION-equivalent evidence note; (c) leave those specific cells `partial` with justification.

## Confirmed VERSION-ABSENT (legitimate n/a, no pinning needed)
- v83 MOB_SKILL_DELAY (cb) — v95 first adds it (case 303). v84 HAS it (case 261, Decode4×4) — a real v84≠v83 delta; the codec must gate it `MajorAtLeast(84)` for that op (NOT the usual ≥87).
- v87 MOB_ESCORT_COLLISION + escort family — absent in v87.
- jms MOB_SPEAKING/INC_MOB_CHARGE_COUNT/MOB_SKILL_DELAY — absent.
- (See `structures/applicability.md` for the authoritative grid.)

## Stage 2 entry notes (from harvest)
- Serverbound send-side functions captured ~0 Decode calls (harvester is Decode-focused) → hand-trace Encode order from the decompile / COutPacket build sites for serverbound codecs.
- `CMob::Update` backs FIELD_DAMAGE_MOB / MOB_DAMAGE_MOB_FRIENDLY / MOB_SKILL_DELAY_END — derive per-op payloads from the COutPacket build sites, not the shared read-side.
- `CField_MonsterCarnival::OnRequestResult` demuxes SUMMON (arg≠0: Decode1,Decode1,DecodeStr) vs MESSAGE (arg=0: single Decode1; strings from StringPool).
- Carnival ops live under new pkg `monster/carnival/{clientbound,serverbound}` (keeps `monster/` tier-1 prefix).
- Gate rule: `MajorAtLeast(87)`, except the v84-only MOB_SKILL_DELAY delta noted above.

## Stage 2 progress

- **Cluster D** (CRC/misc, 4 ops) — committed `95178fbdf`.
- **Cluster A** (combat/damage, 10 ops) — committed `2db28f14c` (clientbound trio) +
  `b4394460e` (serverbound damage). 9 of 10 ops landed; matrix --check exit 0.
  - Clientbound: MOB_AFFECTED, MONSTER_SPECIAL_EFFECT_BY_SKILL (v95-only 3-field
    layout, region+major gate), RESET_MONSTER_ANIMATION — ✅ all 5.
  - Serverbound: FIELD_DAMAGE_MOB ✅5, MOB_DAMAGE_MOB ✅5, MOB_DAMAGE_MOB_FRIENDLY
    (reconciled to pre-existing character/MonsterDamageFriendly) ✅5, MONSTER_BOMB
    ✅4 (v84 sender unnamed), MOB_SKILL_DELAY_END ✅4 (v83 version-absent),
    MOB_TIME_BOMB_END ✅2 (v95/jms; v83/v84/v87 inlined into CMob::Update).
  - **2.A7 TOUCH_MONSTER_ATTACK — DEFERRED (not landed).** CUserLocal::TryDoingBodyAttack
    is a large, branch-heavy, version-DIVERGENT attack packet, NOT byte-plumbing:
    v83 (opcode 0x30 @0x9593f7) has two distinct serialization branches (touch vs
    body attack) with a per-hit detail loop; v95 (opcode 0x32 @0x931a6d) is a wholly
    different shape (field-key, _DR_INFO crypto-masked fields, GetCrc32 checksum,
    SKILLLEVELDATA, ATTACKINFO[15] hit loop). The two are not byte-compatible. jms
    TryDoingBodyAttack Hex-Rays decompile FAILS (per applicability.md fn9). A faithful
    5-version codec requires modeling the full attack/hit-detail structure — out of
    scope for this batch. Left as a follow-up; no codec/route landed (the opcode stays
    "unhandled" rather than shipping a knowingly-wrong codec). Registry rows untouched.

### v84/registry opcode corrections made in Cluster A (IDB-verified, were csv-stale)
- clientbound: MOB_AFFECTED 245→251/0xFB; MONSTER_SPECIAL_EFFECT_BY_SKILL 247→253/0xFD
  (CMobPool::OnMobPacket @0x68fef7 dispatcher cases).
- serverbound: FIELD_DAMAGE_MOB 191→196/0xC4; MOB_SKILL_DELAY_END 195→200/0xC8
  (CMob::Update @0x67dd33 / @0x67d534 COutPacket sites).
- v83 serverbound MOB_SKILL_DELAY_END row removed (version-absent).

## Next: Cluster B (catch/taming), C (monster book), F (version-tail), E (carnival);
then Stage 3 docs, Stage 4 gates+review. Revisit TOUCH_MONSTER_ATTACK as its own task.
