At the hideaway, you'll find the Boss that controls all the other bosses around this area. It's easy to get to the hideout, but the room on the top floor of the place can only be entered ONCE a day. The Boss's Room is not a place to mess around. I suggest you don't stay there for too long; you'll need to swiftly take care of the business once inside. The boss himself is a difficult foe, but you'll run into some incredibly powerful enemies on you way to meeting the boss! It ain't going to be easy.",
